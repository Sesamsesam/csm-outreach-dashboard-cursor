# LinkedIn CSM Enrichment Skill

> **FORMATTING RULE - NO EM DASHES:** Never use em dashes (--) anywhere in any output - not in DMs, cover letters, reports, or any other text. Use a regular hyphen (-) instead. This applies to every piece of text this skill generates, without exception.

For each unprocessed row in the jobs CSV, find up to `{num_contacts}` relevant LinkedIn contacts (per the tiers in the search config), draft personalized DMs for each, write a formal cover letter, save outputs, and update the CSV. Ships tuned for Customer Success Manager, but the skill text names no role - all targeting lives in the search config (loaded in Step 0). Every strategy in this skill was confirmed working in live LinkedIn testing.

This skill drives a real, logged-in browser via **Playwright MCP** (Microsoft's official browser-automation MCP server, connected to Cursor). See the **Browser tool preflight** section - the steps below assume that MCP server is connected and that you are logged into LinkedIn in its persistent browser profile.

---

## ⚠️ The one-and-only data file rule (read first)

There is **exactly one** data file in this project: **`{project_root}/csm_jobs.csv`**. This skill only ever reads from and writes to that file — never create a second CSV, never write to a differently-named or example file. The `update_contacts.py` script enforces this (it refuses any path whose filename isn't `csm_jobs.csv`) and always preserves the file's existing column order, defined once in `{project_root}/schema.py`. Update rows **in place**; do not rewrite or reshape the file yourself.

---

## Browser tool preflight (Playwright MCP)

This skill uses Playwright MCP's core browser tools. **Tool mapping**:

| Action | Playwright MCP tool |
|---|---|
| Go to a URL (People tab, profile) | `browser_navigate` with `{ "url": "..." }` |
| Run JavaScript in the page and read the result (page-ready gate, card/path extraction) | `browser_evaluate` with `{ "function": "() => { ... }" }` or `"async () => { ... }"` |
| Read the rendered page text | `browser_evaluate` with `{ "function": "() => document.body.innerText" }` |
| Capture what's on screen (login wall / CAPTCHA check) | `browser_take_screenshot` |

**Before the first navigation of a run, confirm:**

1. **Playwright MCP is connected to your real Chrome.** If no `browser_*` tools are available, stop and tell the user: "The Playwright MCP browser tool isn't connected. Make sure Chrome is running with the debug port (run `launch-chrome.command` / `.bat` / `.sh`), then run `set up the browser tool` (see BROWSER_SETUP.md) and restart, then try again."
2. **LinkedIn is logged in.** Call `browser_navigate` to `https://www.linkedin.com/feed/`, then `browser_evaluate` with `() => (document.title + ' | ' + (document.body.innerText || '').slice(0, 120))`. If it indicates a sign-in page, stop and tell the user to log into LinkedIn in their real Chrome (the debug-port one). The session lives in the user's **normal Chrome profile** (we drive their real Chrome over CDP), so the login sticks across runs like any normal LinkedIn login.

> **One browser at a time:** the CDP hybrid connects to a single Chrome on port 9222, and a profile can only be used by one browser instance at a time. Do not run two enrichment sessions against the same project simultaneously.

---

## Configuration

- **Project root**: The folder this skill lives in, **auto-located by the helper script** — it walks up from its own location (`.cursor/skills/.../scripts/`) to find the project root (the folder containing `schema.py`). You do **not** need to compute or pass the project path; it works no matter what the current working directory is (important for scheduled runs). All paths below resolve against that auto-located root.
- **Master CSV path** (the only data file): `{project_root}/csm_jobs.csv`
- **Schema (column definitions)**: `{project_root}/schema.py`
- **Cover letters dir**: `{project_root}/cover_letters/`
- **Script path**: `<this skill's directory>/scripts/update_contacts.py`
- **Process rows where**: ALL four contact slots (`contact1_name` through `contact4_name`) are blank — regardless of `outreach_status`. This is keyed on the data, not the date: a row scraped weeks ago that was never enriched is still picked up. **Always enrich anything not yet enriched.**

---

## 🎯 CUSTOMIZE: targeting a different role

> **STOP - is the user asking to change settings, or to run enrichment?** If the user said something like "make the DMs shorter", "be more formal", "don't contact recruiters", "focus the cover letter on sales", or anything about changing *how* outreach is written or *who* gets contacted - **do not run this skill.** That is a settings change. Follow `{project_root}/RETARGETING.md` (or see `AGENTS.md` → "Recognizing a settings change") to update `search_config.json`, then confirm the change. Only run this skill when the user wants to execute enrichment with the current settings.

This skill's behavior is driven entirely by the search config (the code-word legend) - **the skill text itself names no role.** To change or add to enrichment, **don't guess** — the single entry point is **`{project_root}/RETARGETING.md`**, and the change is a single edit to **`search_config.json`** (the menu card). Walk the user through it and confirm each change.

The enrichment code-words (all documented in `RETARGETING.md`) are: `num_contacts`, `contact_tiers`, `role_function`, `recruiter_function_code`, `function_code`, `manager_title_keywords`, `segment_keywords`, `segment_fallback`, `senior_leader_titles`, `dm_tone`, `cover_letter_emphasis`, and `zero_contact_behavior`. Adding a 5th contact (a `contact5_*` slot) is the one case that also touches `schema.py` - see `RETARGETING.md`.

**Forward-only:** retargeting never touches rows already in `csm_jobs.csv`. The CSV schema, the "enrich anything not yet enriched" rule, and the single-master-file rule **do not change** when retargeting — only the config values. After editing `search_config.json`, tell the user what changed.

---

## Contact Priority Tiers

Every job gets up to `{num_contacts}` contacts, in the order defined by `{contact_tiers}` in the config (Step 0). Each tier has a `type` (its label) and a `who` (who to look for). The shipped default `{contact_tiers}` are, in order:

| # | Type | Who | Why |
|---|------|-----|-----|
| 1 | **Recruiter** | Person actively hiring for this role | Most actionable — they hold the role to fill |
| 2 | **Hiring Manager** | Senior leader overseeing the `{role_function}` team | Decision maker |
| 3 | **Peer** | Individual contributor on the same segment team | Warm relationship, insider info |
| 4 | **Senior Business Leader** | One of `{senior_leader_titles}` | Unconventional, memorable — found via profile hopping |

Read the actual tier definitions from `{contact_tiers}` - the table above is just the shipped default. If fewer than `{num_contacts}` contacts are found, record what you have and move on. Never fabricate contacts. Always fill slots sequentially starting at contact1 — never leave contact1 blank if any contacts were found.

**Zero-contact rule:** If after all search strategies you find **no usable contacts at all** (not even Contact 1), the company is low-signal — likely too small, stealth, or not a serious employer for outreach. The configured `zero_contact_behavior` decides what happens: `delete` (default) removes the job via the script's `--delete` mode (see Step 10); `keep` leaves the empty row in the tracker. With the default: Its `job_id` stays in `seen_job_ids.txt`, so the scraper will never re-add it. Do this only when truly zero contacts were found; one or more contacts means keep the row.

---

## ⚙️ Step 0 (DO THIS FIRST) — Load the search config

**The search config is the single source of truth for who this skill looks for and how it writes outreach.** Every decision below - contact tiers, People-tab function codes and keywords, senior-leader titles, DM tone, cover-letter emphasis - uses these values, not the example values written inline. This applies identically to on-demand and scheduled runs.

Load it from the project root, preferring the live file and falling back to the shipped default:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, os
root = os.environ.get('PROJECT_ROOT') or '{project_root}'
for name in ('search_config.json', 'search_config.example.json'):
    p = os.path.join(root, name)
    if os.path.exists(p):
        print(json.dumps(json.load(open(p))['enrichment'])); break
"
```

Bind these code-words; every step below uses them as placeholders, never literal role values:

| Code-word (config key) | Substituted into |
|---|---|
| `{num_contacts}` | how many contact slots to fill |
| `{contact_tiers}` | who Contacts 1..N are (each has `type` + `who`); their labels |
| `{role_function}` | the function phrase in manager/peer searches and selection rules (Steps 4-6) |
| `{recruiter_function_code}` | `facetCurrentFunction=` for Contact 1 (Step 4) |
| `{function_code}` | `facetCurrentFunction=` for Contacts 2-3 (Steps 5-6) |
| `{manager_title_keywords}` | the hiring-manager People-tab `keywords=` (Step 5) |
| `{segment_keywords}` / `{segment_fallback}` | segment parsing (Step 2) |
| `{senior_leader_titles}` | titles to look for in Step 7 |
| `{dm_tone}` | tone for all DMs (Step 8) |
| `{cover_letter_emphasis}` | what the cover letter emphasizes (Step 9) |
| `{zero_contact_behavior}` | `delete` or `keep` a job with no contacts (Step 10) |

**Hard rule:** the steps below contain **only code-words in `{curly braces}`** for anything role-specific - never a literal role name, function, or search phrase. Always substitute the value loaded from the config. The config is the only place the actual values live (the live `search_config.json`, or the committed `search_config.example.json` default). If **neither** file exists, stop and tell the user the search config is missing - do not invent values.

---

## Step 1 — Read unprocessed jobs

Read the CSV at the path above. Identify rows where ALL four contact slots are empty (contact1_name, contact2_name, contact3_name, contact4_name are all blank). Process every such row — do not filter by outreach_status. If all rows already have at least one contact, report that and stop.

For each row, extract:
- `company_linkedin_url` → strip to clean slug URL: `https://www.linkedin.com/company/{slug}/`
- `company_size` → for search strategy selection
- `job_title` → for segment keyword extraction
- `key_requirements` → context for cover letter
- `job_id`, `company`, `company_tagline`, `industry`, `salary` → for cover letter

---

## Step 2 — Extract segment keyword from job title

The segment keyword drives the peer search (Step 6). Parse the job title for any of the `{segment_keywords}` from the config (e.g. a title like "Senior <role>, Strategic" yields the segment `Strategic`). If the title contains none of them, use `{segment_fallback}` as the peer-search keyword.

Also scan the job description / key_requirements for internal team names (e.g., "Enterprise Team"). If found, this beats the title-derived keyword for the peer search.

---

## Step 3 — Get company slug

From `company_linkedin_url`, extract the slug. Examples:
- `https://www.linkedin.com/company/attentivehq/` -> `attentivehq`
- `https://www.linkedin.com/company/servicetitan/life` -> `servicetitan`

Base People tab URL: `https://www.linkedin.com/company/{slug}/people/`

---

## ⏳ Page-ready gate (run after EVERY People-tab / profile navigation in Steps 4-7)

LinkedIn renders People-tab results and profile pages **asynchronously, after the page load event**. Reading too early - the old "wait 2 seconds then read" - is the main cause of empty results and stuck panels: the people cards had not rendered yet. The fix is to **poll the DOM until results exist, then read** - never a fixed sleep.

After every `browser_navigate` in Steps 4-7, run this gate with `browser_evaluate` **before** reading page text or extracting anything. Use `budgetMs` = **15000 on the first navigation of the run** (cold bootstrap is the slow one), **8000** afterwards (warm loads return in ~1-2s).

Call `browser_evaluate` with this function (async is supported - the returned promise is awaited):

```javascript
async () => {
  const budgetMs = 15000;            // FIRST navigation of the run; use 8000 afterwards
  const t0 = performance.now();
  const ready = () => document.querySelectorAll('.org-people-profile-card__profile-info').length > 0;  // People-tab predicate (Steps 4-6)
  while (performance.now() - t0 < budgetMs) {
    const spinner = document.querySelector('.artdeco-loader');
    if (ready() && !spinner) return JSON.stringify({ ready: true, ms: Math.round(performance.now() - t0) });
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 250));
  }
  return JSON.stringify({ ready: false, ms: Math.round(performance.now() - t0), reason: 'timeout' });
}
```

For **Step 7 (a person's profile page)** swap the `ready()` body for:
```javascript
const ready = () => !!document.querySelector('h1') && /experience|about|activity/i.test(document.body.innerText);
```

**Act on the result:**
- `{"ready": true}` -> extract immediately (warm: ~1-2s, so no fixed wait).
- `{"ready": false, "reason": "timeout"}` -> retry the navigation once and gate again. If it still times out, treat that tier as **0 results** and follow the step's 0-results path (it is genuinely empty or gated, not a render race).

> This **replaces every "Wait 2 seconds"** in the steps below. Do not stack fixed sleeps on top of the gate.

---

## Step 4 — Find Contact 1: Recruiter

`browser_navigate` to (use `recruiter_function_code` from the config for `facetCurrentFunction`; default `12`):
```
https://www.linkedin.com/company/{slug}/people/?keywords=recruiter+talent&facetCurrentFunction={recruiter_function_code}
```

Run the **page-ready gate** (People-tab predicate), then read the page text with `browser_evaluate`:
```javascript
() => document.body.innerText
```
Parse the "People you may know" / results section for names and headlines.

Then call `browser_evaluate` with this function to extract paths:
```javascript
() => {
  const cards = document.querySelectorAll('.org-people-profile-card__profile-info');
  const results = Array.from(cards).slice(0, 10).map(card => {
    const nameEl = card.querySelector('.artdeco-entity-lockup__title');
    const subtitleEl = card.querySelector('.artdeco-entity-lockup__subtitle');
    const link = card.querySelector('a[href*="/in/"]');
    const path = link ? new URL(link.href).pathname : null;
    return { name: nameEl?.textContent?.trim(), title: subtitleEl?.textContent?.trim(), path };
  });
  return JSON.stringify(results.filter(r => r.name && r.path));
}
```

**Selection rule**: Pick the recruiter whose headline most specifically targets GTM, `{role_function}`, or relevant roles at this company (e.g., "Hiring GTM @ <company>" over a general recruiter). If multiple recruiters are equally specific, pick the first result.

Save as Contact 1: `name`, `title` (their LinkedIn headline), `linkedin` (full URL: `https://www.linkedin.com{path}`)

---

## Step 5 — Find Contact 2: Hiring Manager

This is the tier-2 contact from `{contact_tiers}`. Build the People-tab `keywords=` from `{manager_title_keywords}` (URL-encode spaces as `+`), choosing the URL based on `company_size`:

- **1K-5K or 5K+** (large):
  ```
  https://www.linkedin.com/company/{slug}/people/?keywords=Director+{role_function}&facetCurrentFunction={function_code}
  ```
- **201-1K** (mid-market):
  ```
  https://www.linkedin.com/company/{slug}/people/?keywords={manager_title_keywords}&facetCurrentFunction={function_code}
  ```
- **11-200** (small):
  ```
  https://www.linkedin.com/company/{slug}/people/?keywords=CEO+Head+VP+Director+Manager+{role_function}
  ```
  (no function filter — small orgs often don't segment by function)

`browser_navigate` to the chosen URL. Run the **page-ready gate**, then `browser_evaluate` with `() => document.body.innerText` to see results. Run the same extraction JS as Step 4 to get paths.

**Selection rule**: Pick the most senior `{role_function}` person (rank: Sr. Director / VP > Director > Head of > Senior Manager). If multiple at same level, prefer someone whose title mentions the segment from Step 2.

**Important**: Validate the person's title actually matches their CURRENT role at this company — headlines can reflect past jobs. Cross-check the company name in their subtitle if visible.

Save as Contact 2.

---

## Step 6 — Find Contact 3: Peer

This is the tier-3 contact from `{contact_tiers}` (an individual contributor on the same team). `browser_navigate` to:
```
https://www.linkedin.com/company/{slug}/people/?keywords={segment_keyword}&facetCurrentFunction={function_code}
```

Where `{segment_keyword}` = what you extracted in Step 2.

Run the **page-ready gate**, then `browser_evaluate` with `() => document.body.innerText` + the path-extraction JS.

**Selection rule**: Pick the first result whose headline contains the segment keyword AND `{role_function}`. Skip anyone with Director/Manager/Head titles (those belong in Contact 2). Prefer results showing a 2nd-degree connection indicator (they appear with "2nd" in the text).

Save as Contact 3.

---

## Step 7 — Find Contact 4: Senior Business Leader (via profile hopping)

`browser_navigate` to Contact 2's LinkedIn profile (the hiring manager found in Step 5).

Run the **page-ready gate** with the **profile predicate** (see the gate section), then `browser_evaluate` with `() => document.body.innerText`. Find the "More profiles for you" section near the bottom.

Parse for people whose titles match `{senior_leader_titles}` from the config. Exclude other `{role_function}` managers/directors — those are already covered by Contact 2.

Call `browser_evaluate` with this function to find their profile paths:
```javascript
() => {
  // Look for 'More profiles for you' section links
  const links = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a[href*="/in/"]'));
  // Filter to unique /in/ paths that aren't the current profile
  const paths = [...new Set(links.map(a => new URL(a.href).pathname))]
    .filter(p => p !== window.location.pathname);
  return JSON.stringify(paths.slice(0, 15));
}
```

Cross-reference the paths against names/titles seen in the page-text output to match the right person.

**Selection rule**: Pick the most senior person from `{senior_leader_titles}` who is not already a tier-2 manager. Prefer whoever sits closest to the business unit the role lives in (e.g. a GM of that unit) over a more distant senior title.

Save as Contact 4.

**Fallback**: If no suitable senior leader found on Contact 2's profile, `browser_navigate` to the company page and search the People tab using a few of the `{senior_leader_titles}` as `keywords=` (e.g. `keywords=VP+General+Manager+CRO`).

---

## Step 8 — Draft DMs

Write a short LinkedIn DM for each contact found. Use the person's name, their title, and the specific job role. **Apply the `{dm_tone}` from the config to all of them.** Keep every DM under 300 characters (LinkedIn's DM character limit is 300 for connection requests; InMail can be longer, but keeping it short is better for response rates).

Tailor each DM to that contact's tier (`type` from `{contact_tiers}`):

### Tier-1 contact (Recruiter)
- Lead with the exact role name
- State your most relevant credential in 1 sentence
- Simple ask: interested in being considered / would love to connect
- Example structure: "Hi [Name], I saw you're recruiting for [exact job title] at [Company]. I have [X years/specific experience]. Would love to be considered!"

### Tier-2 contact (Hiring Manager)
- Reference their team or their department (the `{role_function}` team)
- Lead with what you'd bring to their specific challenge (use key_requirements context)
- Ask if they'd have a few minutes
- Example structure: "Hi [Name], I noticed you lead the [team] at [Company] and you're hiring a [role]. With my background in [relevant skill from key_requirements], I'd love to connect and learn more about the team."

### Tier-3 contact (Peer)
- Casual, no hard sell
- Say you're applying for a similar role and are curious about the team/culture
- Example structure: "Hi [Name], I noticed you're on the [segment] team at [Company] - I'm applying for a similar role and would love to hear a bit about your experience there if you're open to it!"

### Tier-4 contact (Senior Business Leader)
- Bold, specific opener — name the role and show you know their business
- Reference something specific about what they oversee (from job description or company context)
- Simple ask: happy to connect
- Example structure: "Hi [Name], I'm applying for the [role] at [Company] - your work building [their business unit/function] is exactly the kind of environment I'm looking to contribute to. Would love to connect!"

Store the drafted DM as `contact{N}_dm`.

---

## Step 9 — Generate cover letter

Write one formal cover letter per job. Save to:
```
{project_root}/cover_letters/{job_id}_{company_slug}.txt
```
Where `{company_slug}` = company name lowercased with spaces replaced by underscores (e.g., `4380516954_servicetitan.txt`).

**Cover letter format** (~350 words, 4-5 paragraphs). Emphasize what `{cover_letter_emphasis}` from the config calls for:

1. **Opening**: Reference the company's mission/tagline and the specific role. Show genuine interest — not generic.
2. **Relevant experience**: Map 2-3 of the user's strongest credentials to the key_requirements, framed around `{cover_letter_emphasis}`. Be specific.
3. **Why this company**: 2-3 sentences on why this company specifically — use the industry, product, and company_tagline context.
4. **What you bring**: Brief forward-looking paragraph on how you'd contribute.
5. **Closing**: Formal close, express enthusiasm for next steps.

To get `{project_root}` reliably (without depending on the current working directory), run once:
```bash
python "<this skill's dir>/scripts/update_contacts.py" --print-root
```
Use the path it prints as `{project_root}` for the cover-letter file and `user_profile.txt` below.

Before writing the first cover letter, check for `{project_root}/user_profile.txt`. If it exists, read the user's name and email from it (format: `Name: ...` / `Email: ...`). If the file doesn't exist, ask the user for their name and email now, then write the file so future sessions don't need to ask again. Use name and email in the closing signature.

**Tone**: Professional and warm, not robotic. Avoid buzzword soup. It should sound like a real person who did their research.

Create the `{project_root}/cover_letters/` directory if it doesn't exist.

---

## Step 10 — Save to CSV

After processing each job, run the update script:

```bash
python "<this skill's dir>/scripts/update_contacts.py" \
  --job_id "{job_id}" \
  --data '{
    "contact1_name": "...",
    "contact1_title": "...",
    "contact1_linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/...",
    "contact1_dm": "...",
    "contact2_name": "...",
    "contact2_title": "...",
    "contact2_linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/...",
    "contact2_dm": "...",
    "contact3_name": "...",
    "contact3_title": "...",
    "contact3_linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/...",
    "contact3_dm": "...",
    "contact4_name": "...",
    "contact4_title": "...",
    "contact4_linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/...",
    "contact4_dm": "...",
    "cover_letter_path": "{project_root}/cover_letters/{job_id}_{company_slug}.txt"
  }'
```

Use the actual absolute path to `scripts/update_contacts.py` inside this skill's directory. **You do not need to pass `--csv`** — the script auto-locates `csm_jobs.csv` in the project root from its own location, so it works regardless of the current working directory. For `cover_letter_path`, use the `{project_root}` you obtained via `--print-root` above. Leave blank any contact fields where no person was found (but at least Contact 1 should be filled — see the zero-contact rule).

**If zero contacts were found for a job**, follow `{zero_contact_behavior}` from the config. If it is `keep`, leave the empty row in place and do nothing. If it is `delete` (the shipped default), do not run the update command above - instead delete the row:

```bash
python "<this skill's dir>/scripts/update_contacts.py" \
  --job_id "{job_id}" \
  --delete
```

This removes the low-signal job from the tracker while leaving its `job_id` in `seen_job_ids.txt` so it's never re-scraped.

---

## Step 11 — Report back

After all rows are processed, report:
- How many jobs were enriched
- How many jobs were deleted for having zero contacts (and which companies)
- For each enriched job: company name, contacts found (N/4), their names and types
- Path to updated CSV
- List of cover letter files created

Example:
```
Enriched 2 jobs:

Acme Corp (4 contacts):
  1. Recruiter - Jane Smith (/in/janesmith)
  2. Hiring Manager - Alona Markowitz, Sr. Director (/in/alonamarkowitz)
  3. Peer - Nicole Moore (/in/nicoleanderson)
  4. Senior Business Leader - Alex Kablanian, GM Commercial (/in/alexkablanian)
  Cover letter: cover_letters/4380516954_acme_corp.txt

Globex (3 contacts):
  1. Recruiter - Andrea Rodriguez (/in/androdriguez)
  2. Hiring Manager - Karen DiClemente, Sr. Director (/in/karendiclemente)
  3. Peer - Miriam W., Strategic segment (/in/miriamw)
  4. Senior Business Leader - not found
  Cover letter: cover_letters/4429905861_globex.txt
```
(The tier labels above come from `{contact_tiers}` - they reflect the shipped default tiers.)

---

## Edge Cases

- **0 results on People tab search**: First make sure this is a true empty result, not an early read - the page-ready gate (run after the navigation) only reports `ready:true` once cards exist, so a gate timeout after one retry means genuinely 0. Then try removing the `facetCurrentFunction` parameter and retry. If still 0, skip that contact tier and move on.
- **Zero contacts for the whole job** (no Contact 1 after every strategy): Follow `{zero_contact_behavior}` (Step 10) - `delete` removes the row with `--delete`, `keep` leaves it. The default `delete` avoids re-attempting empty rows on every future run.
- **Acquired company / company page shows new brand**: Try the original slug anyway; if People tab is empty, search the new parent company's slug.
- **Contact 2 profile shows no "More profiles for you"**: Skip Contact 4 for this job.
- **DM > 300 characters**: Trim to under 300, keeping the core ask and name intact.
- **Cover letter dir missing**: Create it with `mkdir -p` before writing.
- **Login wall appears**: Stop immediately and ask the user to log into LinkedIn in their real Chrome (the debug-port one - see Browser tool preflight). The session lives in their normal Chrome profile.
- **Premium (✦) profiles**: Name, title, and path are still extractable from People tab search results even if the full profile is paywalled.
- **Misleading headline (contact seems wrong level)**: The People tab shows LinkedIn headlines, not current job titles. A headline like "Manager overseeing teams with $50M ARR" may refer to a past role. If uncertain, `browser_navigate` to the person's full profile to verify their current role before selecting them as Contact 2.
